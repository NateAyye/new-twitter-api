## Installation

You can install this locally and run your very own version of it by running:

> Note: You will need to have [MongoDBCompass](https://downloads.mongodb.com/compass/mongodb-compass-1.39.0-win32-x64.exe) installed on your machine to run this.

```
git clone https://github.com/NateAyye/new-twitter-api.git
cd new-twitter-api
npm install
```

Once you have MongoDB installed, Just make sure that you are connected to monogDBCompass locally then you can start the server by running the following command in the root of the project:

```shell
npm start
```

Or run it in watch mode so that it restarts the server after you make a change to a file with the following command:

```shell
npm run dev
```
